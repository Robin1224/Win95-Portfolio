    Hello, I'm Robin! I'm a 23 year old front-end development student at the University of Amsterdam. I'm currently in my final year of college, and I'm looking for an internship as a front-end developer. I'm a driven creative developer with a passion for creative and bold designs. I'm very interested in motion design, 3D graphics and creating pleasurable UI and am keen to hone my skills in these subjects. As a developer I work with a focus on accessible, performant, and progressively enhanced projects. I'm an experienced Javascript developer, and have experience working with NextJS, SvelteKit and express. My ultimate goal is to use the web as an art medium, and create engaging artistic experiences that users resonate with, which I'm getting closer to every day. <br /> <br /> PS: I also LOVE music, and I'm always looking for new recommendations!
