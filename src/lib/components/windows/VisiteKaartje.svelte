    Im Robin! I'm a 23 year old front-end development student at the University of Amsterdam. I have a lot of passion for design and creativity in general. In my free time I occasiionally play video games, and value spending time with my friends. I have a lot of experience with vanilla HTML, CSS and Javascript, and a decent amount of experience with NextJS, React and SvelteKit. Aside from this I'm also very passionate about art and fashion, and enjoy challenging gender norms in clothing and personal expression. I also have a passion for all things retro, and own a record player and collection, a polaroid camera and an old film camera that I love to use.
